This is the code repository for [Mastering Python Design Patterns, Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-python-design-patterns-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=), published by Packt.

**A guide to creating smart, efficient, and reusable software**

## What is this book about?
Python is an object-oriented scripting language that is used in a wide range of categories. In software engineering, a design pattern is an elected solution for solving software design problems. Although they have been around for a while, design patterns remain one of the top topics in software engineering, and are a ready source for software developers to solve the problems they face on a regular basis. This book takes you through a variety of design patterns and explains them with real-world examples. You will get to grips with low-level details and concepts that show you how to write Python code, without focusing on common solutions as enabled in Java and C++. You'll also find sections on corrections, best practices, system architecture, and its designing aspects.
This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore Factory Method and Abstract Factory for object creation
* Clone objects using the Prototype pattern
* Make incompatible interfaces compatible using the Adapter pattern
* Secure an interface using the Proxy pattern
* Choose an algorithm dynamically using the Strategy pattern

    def __str__(self):
        return f'the musician {self.name}'
    def play(self):
        return 'plays music'
```
